Okay, the plan is to make a Visual Novel engine in HTML5 and Javascript. It may or may not use new HTML5 Elements.
The features I am planning on adding, in the order of which I think of them, are listed below:

FEATURES:
	-NVL and ADV Modes
	-Animation Support
	-Stretch With Screen
		-Keep Apsect Ratio
	-saving
	-background music/sfx
	-menus
	
	
Ideas:
	-Custom scripting language
		-Still has javaScript support(?)
	-Just use JavaScript with custom functions
	-Use XML like the older one, but with better support for scripting.
